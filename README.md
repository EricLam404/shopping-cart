# Fortnite Shopping Cart Repository
This repository contains code for a Fortnite shopping cart application that utilizes the Fortnite Item Shop API to display the current items available for purchase in the game's item shop. The application allows users to view the current item shop, add items to a shopping cart, and checkout their cart.

This application was created using the Fortnite Item Shop API, React.js and CSS.

This is part of The Odin Project online course.
